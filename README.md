# EIGRP-for-IPv6
The project describes how to configure Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) for IPv6. EIGRP is an enhanced version of the IGRP developed by Cisco. It is an enhanced distance vector protocol that relies on the Diffused Update Algorithm (DUAL) to calculate the shortest path to a destination within a network. EIGRP for IPv6 works in the same way as EIGRP IPv4 where they can be configured and managed separate
